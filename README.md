# TMDB API

The project was created using the API of the TMDB page. You can find the description of the functions and their usage at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction.

In order to use the project, you must be a member of the TMDB page and then the authorization procedures must be done. After getting the API key from the settings page, session_id should be obtained from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/how-do-i-generate-a-session-id page.

API key, session_id and username must be written into the variables in the file in \src\main\java\com\tmdb\spec\RequestSpec.java.
